Elevating the count of hidden nodes can enhance accuracy, but it accompanies escalated data and training time demands. The network's proficiency in grasping input patterns improves, yet there's a peril of overfitting.

Accuracy typically rises with an increase in hidden units, but there's a threshold beyond which further units might not significantly enhance performance. This could even result in a slight decline due to overfitting or other considerations.
